Executive Summary

This project develops an executive performance dashboard evaluating dealer-level sales, profit variability, and service-related risk indicators. The objective was to transform transactional sales data into structured commercial intelligence for regional leadership.
By integrating profit trends, dealer ranking, model-level contribution, recall exposure, and customer sentiment analysis, the dashboard enables performance evaluation beyond volume metrics.
The solution connects sales performance with operational risk to support informed strategic decision-making.

Financial & Strategic Framing

This project evaluates:
•	Dealer-level profit concentration
•	Model-level contribution variance
•	Year-over-year profitability shifts
•	Recall exposure by model & system
•	Customer sentiment impact on brand perception

Key commercial insight:
High volume does not necessarily equal optimal profitability. Integrated financial and operational visibility reduces blind spots in regional performance management.
This project demonstrates executive dashboard design aligned with commercial and operational decision-making.
